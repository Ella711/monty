Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
General

    What do LIFO and FIFO mean
    What is a stack, and when to use it
    What is a queue, and when to use it
    What are the common implementations of stacks and queues
    What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues
    What is the proper way to use global variables

Requirements
General

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c90
    All your files should end with a new line
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
    Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
    You allowed to use a maximum of one global variable
    No more than 5 functions per file
    You are allowed to use the C standard library
    The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called monty.h
    Don’t forget to push your header file
    All your header files should be include guarded
    You are expected to do the tasks in the order shown in the project


Compilation & Output

    Your code will be compiled this way:

$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c90 *.c -o monty

    Any output must be printed on stdout
    Any error message must be printed on stderr
        Here is a link to a GitHub repository that could help you making sure your errors are printed on stderr

Tests

We strongly encourage you to work all together on a set of tests
The Monty language

Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

Monty byte code files

Files containing Monty byte codes usually have the .m extension. Most of the industry uses this standard but it is not required by the specification of the language. There is not more than one instruction per line. There can be any number of spaces before or after the opcode and its argument:

julien@ubuntu:~/monty$ cat -e bytecodes/000.m
push 0$
push 1$
push 2$
  push 3$
                   pall    $
push 4$
    push 5    $
      push    6        $
pall$
julien@ubuntu:~/monty$

Monty byte code files can contain blank lines (empty or made of spaces only, and any additional text after the opcode or its required argument is not taken into account:

julien@ubuntu:~/monty$ cat -e bytecodes/001.m
push 0 Push 0 onto the stack$
push 1 Push 1 onto the stack$
$
push 2$
  push 3$
                   pall    $
$
$
                           $
push 4$
$
    push 5    $
      push    6        $
$
pall This is the end of our program. Monty is awesome!$

The monty program

    Usage: monty file
        where file is the path to the file containing Monty byte code
    If the user does not give any file or more than one argument to your program, print the error message USAGE: monty file, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
    If, for any reason, it’s not possible to open the file, print the error message Error: Can't open file <file>, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
        where <file> is the name of the file
    If the file contains an invalid instruction, print the error message L<line_number>: unknown instruction <opcode>, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
        where is the line number where the instruction appears.
        Line numbers always start at 1
    The monty program runs the bytecodes line by line and stop if either:
        it executed properly every line of the file
        it finds an error in the file
        an error occured
    If you can’t malloc anymore, print the error message Error: malloc failed, followed by a new line, and exit with status EXIT_FAILURE.
    You have to use malloc and free and are not allowed to use any other function from man malloc (realloc, calloc, …)
